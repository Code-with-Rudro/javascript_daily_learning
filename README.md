# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Challenge

## 🌟 Beginning My JavaScript Journey

Hello World! 👋  

Today marks **Day 1** of my JavaScript learning challenge.  
I have officially started my journey into the world of programming with **JavaScript**, one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages in the world.

I am learning from the **Apna College YouTube Channel – JavaScript Tutorial Series**, and I am super excited to explore everything step by step.

---

## 📅 Day 1 Progress

Today I completed and understood:

- ✅ Variables  
- ✅ Data Types  
- ✅ Operators  
- ✅ Conditional Statements  
- ✅ Solved a practice problem (grading system based on marks)

Each topic helped me build a stronger foundation in understanding how JavaScript works behind the scenes.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

### 🔹 Variables
Learned how to store data using:
- `let`
- `var`
- `const`

### 🔹 Data Types
Explored different types of data like:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined

### 🔹 Operators
Understood:
- Arithmetic operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators

### 🔹 Conditional Statements
Practiced decision-making in JavaScript using:
- `if`
- `else`
- `else if`

I also solved a small problem where I assigned grades based on marks.  
This helped me understand how conditions work in real scenarios.

# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Challenge

## 📅 Day 2 – Mastering Loops

Welcome to Day 2 of my JavaScript learning journey! 💻✨  
Today, I explored one of the most important concepts in programming — **Loops**.

I am continuing my learning from the Apna College YouTube Channel JavaScript Tutorial series, and each day I feel more confident with JavaScript fundamentals.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered Today

Today I completed:

- ✅ for loop  
- ✅ while loop  
- ✅ do...while loop  
- ✅ for...of loop  
- ✅ for...in loop  

Understanding loops helped me learn how to repeat tasks efficiently instead of writing repetitive code.

---

## 🧠 Practice Problems Solved

### 1️⃣ Finding Even Numbers (1–100)

I wrote a program to:
- Print all even numbers between 1 and 100  
- Use loop logic with condition checking  

This helped me understand iteration and conditional logic together.

---

### 2️⃣ Number Guessing Game 🎯

I built a simple number guessing game where:
- The system selects a number
- The user guesses the number
- The loop runs until the correct number is guessed

This was a fun way to apply loops in a real-world mini project!

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- How loops reduce code repetition  
- When to use different types of loops  
- How logic building improves with practice  
- How small projects improve understanding  

---

## 🎯 Challenge Goal

- Learn daily  
- Practice consistently  
- Push code to GitHub  
- Improve problem-solving skills  

---

🔥 Day 2 Complete!  
Excited to continue learning and building.

Stay tuned for Day 3 🚀

# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Challenge

## 📅 Day 3 – Exploring Strings

Welcome to Day 3 of my JavaScript learning journey! 💻✨  

Today I focused on understanding **Strings** — one of the most commonly used data types in JavaScript.

I am continuing my learning from the Apna College YouTube JavaScript tutorial series and strengthening my fundamentals step by step.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered Today

✅ String Basics  
✅ String Methods / Functions  
✅ Template Literals  
✅ Practice Problem – Username Generator  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔹 String Concepts
- How strings store text data
- String indexing
- String immutability

### 🔹 String Functions
- length property
- toUpperCase()
- toLowerCase()
- trim()
- slice()
- concat()

These methods helped me understand how to manipulate and format text data efficiently.

### 🔹 Template Literals
I learned how to use backticks (` `) to:
- Insert variables inside strings
- Create dynamic strings
- Write cleaner and more readable code

---

## 🎯 Practice Problem – Username Generator

I solved a problem where:

- A full name is given as input
- The program creates a username
- The username is generated using the name + its length

Example:
Full Name: John Doe  
Username: johndoe8  

This problem helped me combine:
- String manipulation
- Length property
- Basic logic building

---

## 🔥 Progress So Far

- ✅ Day 1 – Variables, Data Types, Operators, Conditionals  
- ✅ Day 2 – Loops & Mini Projects  
- ✅ Day 3 – Strings & String Methods  

---

Consistency is my goal.  
Small daily improvements are building strong fundamentals.

Excited for Day 4 🚀
