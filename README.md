# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Challenge

## 🌟 Beginning My JavaScript Journey

Hello World! 👋  

Today marks **Day 1** of my JavaScript learning challenge.  
I have officially started my journey into the world of programming with **JavaScript**, one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages in the world.

I am learning from the **Apna College YouTube Channel – JavaScript Tutorial Series**, and I am super excited to explore everything step by step.

## 📅 Day 1 Progress

Today I completed and understood:

- ✅ Variables  
- ✅ Data Types
