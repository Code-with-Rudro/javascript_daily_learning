# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Challenge

## 🌟 Beginning My JavaScript Journey

Hello World! 👋  

Today marks **Day 1** of my JavaScript learning challenge.  
I have officially started my journey into the world of programming with **JavaScript**, one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages in the world.

I am learning from the **Apna College YouTube Channel – JavaScript Tutorial Series**, and I am super excited to explore everything step by step.

---

## 📅 Day 1 Progress

Today I completed and understood:

- ✅ Variables  
- ✅ Data Types  
- ✅ Operators  
- ✅ Conditional Statements  
- ✅ Solved a practice problem (grading system based on marks)

Each topic helped me build a stronger foundation in understanding how JavaScript works behind the scenes.

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

### 🔹 Variables
Learned how to store data using:
- `let`
- `var`
- `const`

### 🔹 Data Types
Explored different types of data like:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined

### 🔹 Operators
Understood:
- Arithmetic operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators

### 🔹 Conditional Statements
Practiced decision-making in JavaScript using:
- `if`
- `else`
- `else if`

I also solved a small problem where I assigned grades based on marks.  
This helped me understand how conditions work in real scenarios.

## 📅 Day 2 – Mastering Loops

Welcome to Day 2 of my JavaScript learning journey! 💻✨  
Today, I explored one of the most important concepts in programming — **Loops**.

I am continuing my learning from the Apna College YouTube Channel JavaScript Tutorial series, and each day I feel more confident with JavaScript fundamentals.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered Today

Today I completed:

- ✅ for loop  
- ✅ while loop  
- ✅ do...while loop  
- ✅ for...of loop  
- ✅ for...in loop  

Understanding loops helped me learn how to repeat tasks efficiently instead of writing repetitive code.

---

## 🧠 Practice Problems Solved

### 1️⃣ Finding Even Numbers (1–100)

I wrote a program to:
- Print all even numbers between 1 and 100  
- Use loop logic with condition checking  

This helped me understand iteration and conditional logic together.

---

### 2️⃣ Number Guessing Game 🎯

I built a simple number guessing game where:
- The system selects a number
- The user guesses the number
- The loop runs until the correct number is guessed

This was a fun way to apply loops in a real-world mini project!

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- How loops reduce code repetition  
- When to use different types of loops  
- How logic building improves with practice  
- How small projects improve understanding  

---

## 🎯 Challenge Goal

- Learn daily  
- Practice consistently  
- Push code to GitHub  
- Improve problem-solving skills

🔥 Day 2 Complete!  
Excited to continue learning and building.

Stay tuned for Day 3 🚀
